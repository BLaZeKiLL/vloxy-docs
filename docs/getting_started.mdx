# Getting Started

:::caution Compatibility

Currently Tested with Unity 2021.3 LTS and URP. Collections package recently had some breaking changes so older versions of unity might not work

:::

## Quick Start

- Get started by installing **Vloxy Engine** using one of the following methods
  - Unity Package latest can be found **[here](https://github.com/BLaZeKiLL/VloxyEngine/releases)**
  - OpenUPM, more info can be found **[here](https://openupm.com/packages/io.codeblaze.vloxyengine/)**
```bash title="OpenUPM Install Command"
openupm add io.codeblaze.vloxyengine
```

:::tip Choosing Installation Method

While UPM is supported via OpenUPM, it is still recommended to add **Vloxy Engine** directly too the project as a package.
With source access you would get the maximum control and freedom to tune the engine to you'r use case.

:::

- Make sure the following dependencies are installed, they should be installed **automatically** regardless of the way you install **Vloxy Engine**
  - [Unity Maths](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@1.2/manual/index.html)
  - [Unity Burst](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.7/manual/index.html)
  - [Unity Collections](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@1.2/manual/index.html)

- After the package is imported you can open up one of the sample scene or import one of the world pre-fabe into your current scene.
in case you go the pre-fabe route make sure to set the focus parameter on the world object around which the world would be generated.

## Usage
- Looking at samples is a great place to start, They demonstrate how different parts of the engine can be configured to achive the desired results.
- For basic use-cases you could even use the samples out of the box just by tweaking some settings but the real power of voxel engine lies in it's extensibility.
