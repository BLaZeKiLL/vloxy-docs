**Vloxy Engine** focuses on performant mesh generation from voxel data. In one sentance, you provide the data the engine gives of meshes.

| Jobs & Burst                    |  ✔   |
| Extensible Api                  |  ✔   |
| Serialization                   |      |
| Streaming & Infinite generation |  ✔   |
| Noise Generation System         |      |
| Physics & Fluids                |      |
| Networking                      |      |


The engine is extensible using 2 paradigms. OOP based overrieds are avaliable for high level functionality with full controls.
as well as restrictive, functional overrieds for performance intensive code.

## Getting Started

Get started by **cloning the [source code](https://github.com/BLaZeKiLL/VloxyEngine)**.

:::tip Installation Method

While support for UPM is planned it is still recommended to add vloxy engine directly too the project.
you could add it as a git submodule.

With source access you would get the maximum control

:::

For additional options and detailed setup check **[here](category/installation)**

### What you'll need

Currently Tested for Unity 2021.3 LTS and URP.

Dependencies :-
- [Unity Maths](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@1.2/manual/index.html)
- [Unity Burst](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.7/manual/index.html)
- [Unity Collections](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@1.2/manual/index.html)

## Configuring

Ideally you would be extending the **VloxyWorld** class but to get up and running you can drag
any of the example world to the scene
