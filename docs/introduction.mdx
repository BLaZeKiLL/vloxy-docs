**Vloxy Engine** focuses on performant mesh generation from voxel data. In one sentence, you provide the data the engine gives of meshes.

## Current Goals
| Description                     | Done |
|---------------------------------|:----:|
| Jobs & Burst                    |  ✔   |
| Extensible Api                  |  ✔   |
| Serialization                   |      |
| Streaming & Infinite generation |  ✔   |
| Noise Generation System         |      |
| Physics & Fluids                |      |
| Networking                      |      |

The engine is extensible using 2 paradigms. OOP based overrides are available for high level functionality with full controls.
as well as restrictive, functional overrides for performance intensive code.

## Demos
Along with package releases a demo application showcasing the capabilities is also released for the following platforms
- Windows
- Android
