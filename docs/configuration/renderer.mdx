# Renderer

Renderer Settings are divided in two, Mesh related settings are controlled via the scriptable object but a bulk of it is
controlled by the material, tough the material is passed via the scriptable object.

- **Material** - Main material to be used by chunk meshes
- **Cast Shadows** - Enables shadows for chunk meshes

:::note

Shadows can cause some artifacts which can be fixed by fiddling with projects lighting settings.

:::

## Material
Vloxy Engine comes with shaders for **URP** and **Built-In** render pipelines.

:::caution Compatibility

Shaders for the **Built-In** pipeline require some tweaks to support textures

:::

2 variants of the shaders are provided
- **Vertex Color** - If you want just RGB colored blocks
- **Textured** - If you want textured blocks using texture arrays

both shaderss allow you to control the baked **Ambient Occlusion** curve and it's intensity.
