# Renderer

Renderer Settings are divided in two, Mesh related settings are controlled via the scriptable object but a bulk of it is
controlled by the material, tough the material is passed via the scriptable object.

These settings allow you to control the baked **Ambient Occlusion** curve and enable shadows for the chunk renderer.

:::note

Shadows can cause some artifacts which can be fixed by fiddling with projects lighting settings.
