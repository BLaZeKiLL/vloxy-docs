# Noise

Current Noise Generation API is very primitive, Built using **Unity.Mathematics** and it's **[Noise API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@1.2/api/Unity.Mathematics.noise.html)**
for Burst support.

Currently, the noise generator is restricted too 2D generation using Simplex Noise with few settings exposed like :-

- **Height** - Max hieght of the height map, this value is not a height limit as the engine supports infinite generation in all directions.
this is just the limit for 2D height map generation.
- **Seed** - Offset used to shift the noise textures internally, same vaules will provide the same result
- **Scale** - zoom level or distance between adjecent sample points, higher the value higher the variation
- **Octaves** - Number of layers of noise maps to be applied over each other, Higher value increase computation cost but provide richer result
- **Persistence** - Effect of each subsiquent octave.
- **Lacunarity** - Frequency shift for each subsiquent octave.

A comprehensive noise generation system is part of the plan for Vloxy Engine and work on it will begin post the first release
