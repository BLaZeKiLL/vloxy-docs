# Noise

Current Noise Generation API is very primitive, The project started by using **[Auburn's FastNoiseLite](https://github.com/Auburn/FastNoiseLite)**
which was later replaces by **Unity.Mathematics** and it's **[Noise API](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.mathematics@1.2/api/Unity.Mathematics.noise.html)**
for Burst support.

To simplify this migration noise extension capabilities were removed partly because of **structs** limitations also.
Currently, the noise generator is restricted too 2D generation using Simplex Noise with few settings exposed like :-
- Height
- Seed
- Scale
- Persistence
- Lacunarity
- Octaves

A comprehensive noise generation system is part of the plan for Vloxy Engine and work on it will begin post the first release

:::caution API Changes

Vloxy Engine is under development and API has not been finalized, docs may lag behind and API is subject to change until
the first stable release
