# Chunk

**Chunk Size** is fully changeable, though I test everything at 32x32x32 but in-theory any size should work.

:::danger

Don't make the chunk too big as there is a limitation on the number of vertices a mesh can have in unity

:::

Vloxy Engine dosen't have a concept of Chunk Columns and aims to support infinite chunks in all 3 axis.

:::caution API Changes

Vloxy Engine is under development and API has not been finalized, docs may lag behind and API is subject to change until
the first stable release
