# Chunk

Chunks form the basic building blocks of vloxy engine.
Vloxy Engine dosen't have a concept of Chunk Columns and aims to support infinite chunks in all 3 axis.

Following options are **configurable**
- **Chunk Size** - size of each chunk is fully configurable, though I test everything at 32x32x32 but in-theory any size should work.

:::danger

Don't make the chunk too big as there is a limitation on the number of vertices a mesh can have in unity

:::

- **Draw Distance** - Number of visible chunks around the focus transform (Player)

Following options are **computed at runtime**
- **Load Distance** - Number of chunks around the player to keep in memory.
```csharp
Settings.Chunk.LoadDistance = Settings.Chunk.DrawDistance + 2;
```
