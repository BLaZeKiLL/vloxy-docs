# World
**VloxyWorld** behaviour defines the entry-point to voxel engine. It is responsible for initializing and updating the engine state.

Extending the **VloxyWorld** class is the first thing you will need to do in order to customize the behaviour of the engine.

## Members
**VloxyWorld** exposes the following protected members.

```csharp
protected VloxySettings Settings;
```

Reference to the VloxySettings scriptable object.

```csharp
protected int3 FocusChunkCoord;
```

Current chunk coordinates corresponding to the focus coordinates.

```csharp
protected NoiseProfile NoiseProfile;
```

Noise Profile is used to generate chunk data depending on the noise configuration.

```csharp
protected ChunkManager ChunkManager;
```

Chunk Manager stores currently loaded chunks and decides what chunks to be streamed and meshed.

## Overrides
**VloxyWorld** exposes the following virtual methods.

```csharp
protected virtual VloxyProvider Provider() => new();
```

The provider is pretty integral to the engine, we'll go over its details later but on a high level :-

- Overriding this method would allow you to switch out the provider with your custom implementation of the **VloxyProvider**.
- **VloxyProvider** follows the inversion of control pattern, loosely like dependency injection.
It is the one place where all dependencies and components of the engine are configured.
- Custom **VloxyProvider** allow you to change components of the engine with your own implementation controlling the high level behaviour.
- Custom **VloxyProvider** also allows you to define burst function overrides controlling the low level behaviour.

### Lifecycle Overrides

```csharp
protected virtual void WorldConfigure() { }
```

WorldConfigure is called right after runtime settings are computed. This lifecycle hook can be used change settings at runtime.

```csharp
protected virtual void WorldInitialize() { }
```

WorldInitialize is called right after the provider is initialized.

```csharp
protected virtual void WorldAwake() { }
```

WorldAwake is equivalent to Unity Awake.

```csharp
protected virtual void WorldStart() { }
```

WorldStart is equivalent to Unity Start.

```csharp
protected virtual void WorldUpdate() { }
```

WorldUpdate is equivalent to Unity Update.

```csharp
protected virtual void WorldRegionUpdate() { }
```

WorldRegionUpdate is called every time FocusChunkCoord is updated.

Next we'll look into more ways to configure the engine on a granular level.
